# HEGstudio-Fork-HEGduino
Okay, this is officially obsolete. I can't really get it to work anymore at all. The thing needs to be rewritten in Python 3. I started that project a while ago but gave up since the UI would have to be completely redone from scratch and the rest of the code was so convoluted I couldn't keep going on updating the syntax. - Josh

#### For HEGduino, please now use our [Chrome Extension](https://github.com/moothyknight/HEG_ESP32/tree/master/More/ChromeExtension) for easy USB and Bluetooth Connectivity as HEGstudio seems to have shit the bed.
