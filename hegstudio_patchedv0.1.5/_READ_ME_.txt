Patched HEGstudio for HEGduino on Windows!
******************************************
Changelog:
12/11/19
Changed HEGstudio to use raw SMA for HEGduino (it works!), I should use a better smoothing algo.

9/15/19
Updated to fit new output format on HEGduino. HEGFlight is janky but the graph seems good.
Recommend sticking to HEGMovie.

0.4.9
HEGmovie mode fixed, works without disk now too. Right click the video to
select a new movie file.
SimpleGraphs kind of works, gotta fix autosizing. 
Fixed rest of the deprecated code found so far.

Make sure you adjust the HEG sma window in parsers.py if you change the 
sampling rate on the arduino.

0.4.8d + patch 0.1.3
Make sure the HEG is plugged in before starting up the program. 

Not sure how many of the features work aside from the data stream.

Data stream compares the current simple-moving-average of the last 5 samples
to the last read value and adds or subtracts that difference, scaled down by 10x.
This just about mimics the peanut output, not sure it's the same method but it works. 

Sensitivity cannot be modifed yet except in the source (via onHEGduinoData function in parsers.py past line 1100 in AutoHEG class).

*****************
Source code requires these extra non-default packages (pip install or conda install):
wxPython
pyserial
MplayerCtrl
numpy
*****************
Build with pyinstaller (available via pip):
>>> pyinstaller hegstudio.pyw -F

JToomim's Notes:
Changes since 0.4.8b:
	- Added mostly complete unicode support to allow user profiles and paths with UTF-8 characters.

Changes since 0.4.7a:

- The File -> New Session feature actually works now. You have the
ability to specify several pieces of information about the session of
you want, such as the training location and a file description (which
will both be included in the autogenerated filename), any notes you
might want to write down, the folder you want to save it into, and the
subject. All of these pieces of information will be saved as metadata in
the generated file, and will be viewable and possibly editable in future
releases. You may type in a training location if you want. Please don't
type in a folder name yet, as that will probably cause a crash; I'll
make it create a folder if it doesn't exist in the next release. The
Time Limit field is not currently enforced, but will be in subsequent
releases. The Subject field is NOT the same as the user profile; you can
type whatever you want there.

- A minor bug which caused some sessions to not show up in Review
Sessions was fixed. This bug may also have caused rare and intermittent
errors when trying to start a new session. (It was a problem with Peanut
protocol autodetection.)

- HEGDiag allows you to graph sessions quickly now by typing "fast #"
into the box on the right. Not that any of you care...

- HEGMovie (beta) mode had an issue causing the video feedback to be
substantially delayed on some machines. This should be fixed now. Let me
know if the brightness and pausing doesn't closely track the blue/red
bar in the bottom right corner.

- HEGMovie (beta) will only play the movie when a session is running.

- HEGMovie (beta) is still buggy, and likely to not work (well?) on
Mac OS X. Use it at your own risk.
